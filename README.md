## 🛠️ Design Process & Technical Details
This project was built entirely in **Figma** with a strong emphasis on developer-ready practices:
- **Auto Layout:** Strict use of `Shift + A` for all cards, sections, and buttons to ensure responsive resizing.
- **Component Architecture:** Created reusable variants for the pricing tiers and interactive testimonial carousels.
- **Grid System:** Utilized a 12-column layout grid for standard desktop spacing and visual hierarchy.
- **Prototyping:** Implemented 'Smart Animate' for seamless component swapping.
